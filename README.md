💡 A1) Sure! Here are the explanations and code examples for each CSS position:

Static:
• The default position value for an element.
• It follows the normal document flow.
• Elements are positioned based on their order in the HTML markup.
• Does not respond to top, bottom, left, or right properties.

This is a static positioned element.
.static-example {
position: static;
}

Fixed:
• The element is positioned relative to the viewport.
• It remains fixed in its position even when the page is scrolled.
• Does not affect the position of other elements.
• It can be positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties.

This is a fixed positioned element.
.fixed-example {
position: fixed;
top: 20px;
left: 20px;
}

Sticky:
• The element is positioned based on the user's scroll position.
• It behaves like a relatively positioned element until a specified threshold is met, then becomes fixed.
• When scrolling reaches the threshold, the element sticks to that position.
• It can be positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties.

This is a sticky positioned element.
.sticky-example {
position: sticky;
top: 50px;
}

Relative:
• The element is positioned relative to its normal position.
• It can be moved using the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
• It does not affect the position of other elements.

This is a relative positioned element.
.relative-example {
position: relative;
left: 20px;
}

Absolute:
• The element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor or the initial containing block if no ancestor is positioned.
• It is taken out of the normal document flow.
• It can be moved using the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
• It does not leave a gap in the layout where it was originally positioned.

This is an absolute positioned element.
.parent {
position: relative;
}

.absolute-example {
position: absolute;
top: 0;
left: 0;
}

These are the explanations and code examples for the CSS positions. Feel free to modify the CSS properties to see the effects in your own HTML struct

💡 A2 Certainly! Here's an example of a form with basic validation for the fields you mentioned:

Name:
Email:
Phone Number:
Password:
Age:
Gender:
Select Male Female Other

Date:
Favorite Color:
Submit

<script> const form = document.getElementById('gaurav'); form.addEventListener('submit', function(event) { event.preventDefault(); const name = document.getElementById('name').value; const email = document.getElementById('email').value; const phone = document.getElementById('phone').value; const password = document.getElementById('password').value; const age = document.getElementById('age').value; const gender = document.getElementById('gender').value; const date = document.getElementById('date').value; const color = document.getElementById('color').value; if (name "Gaurav Kumar Jha'' || email "gjha5345@gmail.com '' || phone "7049019695 '' || password "########### '' || age "25'' || gender "Male '' || date "2 - 7 - 2023 '' || color "Green '') { alert('Please fill in all fields.'); return; } // Additional validation can be performed here for each field // Submit the form if all fields are valid alert('Form submitted successfully!'); form.reset(); }); </script>
💡 A3 The execution context is an important concept in JavaScript that defines the environment in which JavaScript code is executed. It consists of three main components: the Variable Object, the Scope Chain, and the "this" keyword. Together, these components determine how variables, functions, and objects are accessed and executed within a JavaScript program.

Variable Object: The Variable Object is a container that holds variables, function declarations, and function arguments. It stores all the defined variables and functions within the current scope. The Variable Object is created during the creation phase of the execution context.

Scope Chain: The Scope Chain is a list of Variable Objects that represents the hierarchical structure of nested functions and their respective scopes. It allows variables and functions to be accessed from an outer or parent scope. When a variable or function is not found in the current execution context, the JavaScript engine looks up the Scope Chain to find the variable or function in the outer scopes.

"this" keyword: The "this" keyword refers to the object that is currently being operated on or the object that owns the code being executed. It provides a way to access the properties and methods of the current object.

Now, let's explain the concept of execution context using a diagram:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Global Execution Context │
│ │
│ Variable Object: Global variables and functions │
│ │
│ Scope Chain: [] (empty array) │
│ │
│ this: Refers to the global object (e.g., window) │
│ │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
^
│
│
┌──────────────────────────┐
│ Function A Execution Context │
│ │
│ Variable Object: Local variables and functions │
│ │
│ Scope Chain: [Global Variable Object] │
│ │
│ this: Refers to the object that invokes Function A│
│ │
└──────────────────────────┘
^
│
│
┌──────────────────────────┐
│ Function B Execution Context │
│ │
│ Variable Object: Local variables and functions │
│ │
│ Scope Chain: [Function A Variable Object, Global Variable Object] │
│ │
│ this: Refers to the object that invokes Function B│
│ │
└──────────────────────────┘
In the above diagram, we have the Global Execution Context at the top, representing the global scope. It has its own Variable Object, which contains global variables and functions. The Scope Chain is empty since there are no outer scopes. The "this" keyword in the global execution context refers to the global object (e.g., the window object in a browser environment).

Below the Global Execution Context, we have two nested function execution contexts: Function A and Function B. Each function has its own Variable Object that stores local variables and function declarations. The Scope Chain in each function includes the Variable Object of its parent function and the Global Variable Object, allowing access to variables and functions in the outer scopes. The "this" keyword in each function execution context refers to the object that invokes the respective function.

This hierarchical structure of execution contexts and their respective Variable Objects and Scope Chains allows JavaScript code to access and manage variables and functions across different scopes within a program.

💡 A5 Certainly! Here's an example of how you can implement a CSS grid layout to display a gallery of images in a grid format:

<style> .gallery { display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); grid-gap: 10px; }
.gallery img {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
</style>
Image 1 Image 2 Image 3 Image 4 Image 5 Image 6 Image 7 Image 8 Image 9
In the above code, we create a div with the class "gallery" to contain our gallery of images. The CSS for the "gallery" class sets it as a CSS grid with three columns (grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr)) and a gap of 10 pixels between each image (grid-gap: 10px).

The img elements inside the "gallery" div will automatically fill up the available space in each grid cell due to the width: 50% rule, and the height: auto property ensures that the images maintain their aspect ratio.

You can replace the src attribute of each img tag with the actual image URLs or file paths you want to display in the grid. Remember to update the alt attribute with meaningful descriptions for accessibility purposes.

Note: Make sure to replace "image1.jpg," "image2.jpg," and so on with the actual image URLs or file paths you want to use.
